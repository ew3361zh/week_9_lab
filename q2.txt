What does this Vue warning message mean? 
Can you safely ignore it? 
What causes it, and how do you fix it?  
Write an answer in your own words. 

The message means that there is a variable or piece of data (or property) referenced in the html Vue app section but that we have not yet defined what it is in our
Vue app script. So it would not be safe to ignore it because it will be an undefined value and if we're relying on our app to show a user 
specific data represented in that variable, not defining what it's supposed to be would be a gap in functionality for our app. It may still
do many of the things we want it to based on what piece of data is not rendered, but it could also be central to the app's functionality and
be kind of a disaster to the app.
We would fix this by defining the property/variable in our Vue script - whatever information is supposed to go in there for the app to display.
